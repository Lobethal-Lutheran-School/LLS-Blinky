LLS-Blinky

This repository contains the schematic, layout and gerber files for Lobethal LutheranSchool's themed Blinky PCB.

The Blinky project allows students to try soldering, and learn about algorithms and coding embedded devices, in this case, an Atmel attiny13/45/85 eight pin microcontroller.

Others hoping to do a simila rpoject can use the same schematic file, and PCB layout template to design their own bespoke layout.

Those seeking to creat customised line art for their own version of the PCB can use https://github.com/erichVK5/inkscape2pcb to generate footprints with elements that be used on the silkscreen, copper or solder mask layers.
